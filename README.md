Some parts from [Mini-Circuits®](http://www.minicircuits.com) brought onto two-sided PCBs with 1mm FR4 core and 35µm copper.

## Cloning

git clone --recursive https://github.com/jue89/kicad-minicircuits.git
cd kicad-minicircuits
./setup.sh

## Generating Gerber files

I found a little python script for plotting Gerber files in the KiCad repository (demos/python\_scripts\_examples). It will be called by the plot Bash script

```
./plot.sh
```
